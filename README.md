# TripLand

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

TripLand is a web app where users can create trips they plan on taking.  Users can also edit, delelte and look at all of their trips.  All trips are displayed via each user so that users can browse other trips looking for inspiration.

## Getting Started

### Front-End

Fork and clone the repo [here](https://github.com/Leepzig/trips-client-side) and then run `yarn start` in the terminal; the webpage should load on your default browser.

### Back-End

Then fork and clone the backend [here](https://github.com/Leepzig/sinatra-trips) and run `rake db:seed` to have some data in the project.  Then run `rake server` to spin up a server.
